      "aiSummary": "This single day in a two-week project phase marks a strategic migration from raw Next.js app structure to a structured **ShadCN UI library**-based component system, emphasizing modularity and designer-friendly usability. The key addition is the reusable `Button` component framework, which leverages modern design tools (Tailwind CSS variants + Radix UI slots) for consistency and accessibility. The introduction of utility functions and configuration aligns with a growing trend toward streamlined class merging and semantic design patterns within React applications. This commitment to architectural discipline hints at an early realization that reusable components could reduce boilerplate and improve maintainability, but also introduces new dependencies for robust styling solutions.",
      "keyDecisions": [
        "Establish shadcn.json as the *component registry* for standardized UI elements, ensuring a controlled migration toward Tailwind's utility-first approach",

        "The decision to use **shadcn.json** reveals a deliberate strategy for reducing development time by pre-configuring a design system that users can customize",
        "The utility function for merging Tailwind and `clsx` classes indicates an awareness of the need to balance class naming conventions with dynamic props. This choice reflects a pattern for enabling modular styling without excessive `className` string manipulation.",
        "Using Radix UI's slot mechanism suggests understanding of *radix principles* of unopinionated slots, where components delegate their internal structure to their parent instead of dictating specific markup.",
