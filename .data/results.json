The system retains a fallback path to LM Studio while prioritizing Copilot's deep code understanding. New utilities handle cloning, analysis, and environment verification, supported by comprehensive documentation and setup automation. This shift enables richer insights into architecture, dependencies, and code quality, backed by robust error handling and operational guidance.",
